This bot is designed to help you report bug reports, security issues, and request new features to the MFDLABS Grid Team.


Not all features you request will be implemented, so don't get sad if it ends up being scrapped.

# What is MFDLABS Grid Bot?

This bot, which you can invite with the url linked to this repository, was created by [Nikita Petko](https://github.com/nikita-petko). It was intended to supersede another similar one put together poorly by other users.
It has had a lot of work done on it, and is now a fully functional bot, almost reaching a DAU of over 1K.

# What can be done here?

You can request the following: 
1. [Bug Reports](https://github.com/mfdlabs/grid-bot-support/issues/new?assignees=mfdlabs-ops&labels=Bug+Report%2CRequires+Review%2CBacklogged&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+)
2. [Feature Requests](https://github.com/mfdlabs/grid-bot-support/issues/new?assignees=mfdlabs-ops&labels=Feature+Request%2CEnhancement%2CRequires+Review%2CBacklogged&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BFeature%5D%3A+)
3. [Security Issues](https://github.com/mfdlabs/grid-bot-support/issues/new?assignees=mfdlabs-ops%2Cmfdlabs-sec-ops&labels=Bug+Report%2CSecurity+Vulnerability%2CMission+Critical%2CRequires+Review%2CBacklogged&template=security_vulnerabilty.yml&title=%5BVulnerability%5D%3A+)
4. [Blacklist Appeals](https://github.com/mfdlabs/grid-bot-support/issues/new?assignees=mfdlabs-ops%2Cmfdlabs-sec-ops&labels=Appeal%2CRequires+Review%2CBacklogged&template=blacklist_appeal.yml&title=%5BAppeal%5D%3A+)

These should be carried out with utmost professionalism and care, as otherwise they will be ignored, or will make it harder for the MFDLABS Grid Team to implement them.
